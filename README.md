# MISSION 2400 - RESTORE THE SEVEN.
The Vortex (VX) have infiltrated Planet Static Surge VII (The Seven). Your goal, along with the ones of many others, is to exile them from the planet. If not, they'll destroy it. That planet is the sole reason why we are still able to defend most of the other 98 planets that haven't been overtaken by VX forces.
